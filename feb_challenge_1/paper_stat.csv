Abstarct of the page:	Early secondary sepsis (ESS), occurring after recent inflammatory activation is associated with a reduced inflammatory response. If this attenuation also is associated with decreased bacterial killing, the need for antibiotic efficacy might be greater than in primary sepsis (PS). This prospective, randomised interventional study compares bacterial killing in ESS and PS in a large animal intensive care sepsis model. 38 pigs were intravenously administered live Escherichia coli for 3 h. Before baseline ESS was pre-exposed to endotoxin 24 h, whereas PS was not. Bacterial growth was measured in organs immediately post-mortem, repeatedly during 6 h in blood in vivo and for blood intrinsic bactericidal capacity ex vivo. Splenic growth was lower in ESS animals, than in PS animals (3.31 ± 0.12, vs. 3.84 ± 0.14 log10 CFU/mL, mean ± SEM) (p < 0.01) with a similar trend in hepatic growth (p = NS). Blood bacterial count at 2 h correlated with splenic bacterial count in ESS (ESS: r = 0.71, p < 0.001) and to blood killing capacity in PS (PS: r = 0.69, p < 0.001). Attenuated inflammation in ESS is associated with enhanced antibacterial capacities in the spleen. In ESS blood bacterial count is related to splenic killing and in PS to blood bactericidal capacity. The results suggest no increased need for synergistic antibiotic combinations in ESS.
